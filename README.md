# Traveler advisor
You can see the project live on [this page](https://travel.feernandooff.com/)

## Tech Stack:

- Nextjs
- Framer Motion
- AntDesign
- leaflet Maps

# The focus of this app

Create a Rappi-Looking app with animations that feels like an native app and make it Installable making it a PWA.
Also i wanna try work with maps

### Notes:

The reaso why i choose the Lifeat maps it's because the Travel Advisor by RapidAPI deprecated the fetch by boundary
